# Pac-Man
The Pac-Man projects apply an array of AI techniques to playing Pac-Man.
01_Search
Implement depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms. These algorithms are used to solve navigation and traveling salesman problems in the Pacman world.

02_Multiagent
Classic Pacman is modeled as both an adversarial and a stochastic search problem. Implement multiagent minimax and expectimax algorithms, as well as designing evaluation functions.

03_Reinforcement
Implement model-based and model-free reinforcement learning algorithms, applied to the AIMA textbookâ€™s Gridworld, Pacman, and a simulated crawling robot.

04_Tracking
Probabilistic inference in a Hidden Markov Model tracks the movement of hidden ghosts in the Pacman world. Implement exact inference using the forward algorithm and approximate inference via particle filters.

05_Machinelearning
Implement the perceptron algorithm and neural network models, and apply the models to several tasks including digit classification.
